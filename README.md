## Overview

This is a set of helper code that intends to make using [BrowserID](https://browserid.org/) easier
from inside an Express application. I slapped it together because as I started integrating BrowserID
support into one of my project, I realised that while there were great pieces of code as well as
documentation and examples, most of them using NodeJS already, a decent amount of assembly was
required in order to actually use it (either that, or I didn't find the right pieces ;). That's
not surprising: this is very new technology, and you don't expect it to come in a velvet-padded
case.

`express-browserid` tries to fill that gap. I cannot say that it has seen much production use at this
point since it has essentially been producing by me pasting the code I had used to explore
BrowserID into a module but it ought to be simple to use.

It works by adding its own set of routes to your Express `app` that can:

* verify that a browser assertion is valid and set the email in the session;
* logout (i.e. remove the email from the session);
* send a helper client-side script.

The client-side script knows how to trigger a BrowserID sign-in and contact the verify route
to check that the sign-in is valid. It is easily configurable, and emits events throughout its
lifecycle to enable UI code to react to the sign-in's progress.

## Usage (Server)

Somewhere as part of your routes (i.e. after configuration):

    require("express-browserid").plugAll(app);

This method supports options, and there are other methods that will plug individual routes on their
own rather than all of them at once. Details below.

## Usage (Client)

Include the following script anywhere after having included jQuery and 
https://browserid.org/include.js.

    &lt;script src="/browserid/js/browserid-helper.js" data-debug="true" data-csrf="deadbeef">&lt;/script>

The path to the script can be configured on the server side (or if you prefer, you can load it from your
own public directory â€” but you don't have to). All the data-* attributes that configure its behaviour are 
optional, and there are more than just the ones listed above (details below).

## Installation

    $ npm install express-browserid

## Interface (Server)

The NodeJS side of the code supports the following methods:

* plugAll(app, [opt]). Calls all of the methods below in turn in order to plug all the routes into the app.
  It takes an Express `app` object (required) and optionally a dictionary of options which are passed on to
  the following methods.
* plugHelperScript(app, [opt]). Creates the GET route for the helper script. That defaults to
  `/browserid/js/browserid-helper.js` unless overridden using the options described below.
* plugVerifier(app, [opt]). Creates the POST route for the sign-in verification operation. That defaults to
  `/browserid/verify` unless overridden using the options described below.
* plugLogout(app, [opt]). Creates the "all" route (it works for any HTTP method) that logs the user out by
  unsetting the `email` key in the session. Defaults to `/browserid/logout` unless overridden using the options
  described below.

The methods above accept the following options. `plugAll` accepts them all and passes them on, the others accept
the ones that make sense to them.

* basePath. The root path under which the other routes are set up. It defaults to `/browserid` (note the leading
 `/`). If you change it to `/foo` then logout becomes `/foo/logout`, the verifier `/foo/verify`, etc.
* helperScriptPath. The route for the client-side helper script. This overrides not just the default value, but
  also the value built using `basePath`. That is to say, if you set `basePath` to `/foo` and `helperScriptPath`
  to `/bar/browserid-helper.js` then the route will be `/bar/browserid-helper.js` and won't take `/foo` into 
  account. IMPORTANT NOTE: currently, this path has to end with `browserid-helper.js` otherwise the script won't
  be able to accept configuration correctly. This may change.
* verifierPath. The route to the verify operation. The same note applies for overriding as in `helperScriptPath`.
* logoutPath. The route to the logout operation. The same note applies for overriding as in `helperScriptPath`.
* verifier. The URL for the verification service to use, defaults to "https://browserid.org/verify" but you can
  use any service that follows the specification.
* audience. The scheme + host + optional port (e.g. `http://berjon.com` or `https://github.com:8001`) for which
  this authentication is being made. Only override this if you know what you're doing, the client side is a better
  place to configure this setting (if configured there, it will be used here).
